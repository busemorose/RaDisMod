# RaDisMod

## Description

RaDisMod is an R package developed by Guillaume Cinkus and Vincent Marc at Avignon Universit√©. It contains one function that launches an R shiny application for modelling single flood events using production and transfer functions.

## Installation

RaDisMod requires an installation of R `4.0.0`**. The instruction for the installation and the download of R can be found on the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/).

Once R is installed, KarstID can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/busemorose/RaDisMod).

``` r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools") # install devtools package if needed
devtools::install_github("busemorose/RaDisMod") # install RaDisMod package
```
## Launch

Once the package is installed, the application can be loaded with the `RaDisMod()` function.

``` r
library(RaDisMod)
RaDisMod()
```

or

```
RaDisMod::RaDisMod()
```

## Data import

The data import field allows to load a file with the following conditions:

-   The data must be a plain text file
-   The file must have two columns representing precipitation and observed discharge, respectively named `P` and `obs`
-   The columns must be semicolon-separated and of the same length

### Type of unit hydrogram

Four unit hydrogram are available by default:

- Socose
- Gamma
- Log-normal
- Triangle

It is possible to import a custom unit hydrogram using `Custom` in the drop-down menu. The file for a custom unit hydrogram must be a unique column without header.

The length of the unit hydrogram to consider can be specified with `Length of HU`.
